Each hour of the year is used as unit of analysis

NDW average calculations for trafic intensity and speed are being disregarded to account for this unit of analysis.
Instead trafic intensity and speed are being aggregated over each individual hour. 
Bridge opennings undergo simillar aggregation to construct a new feature - the number of seconds the bridge was open during each individual hour.

We finished one hot-encoding of national and school holidays

We are currently onstructing a new dataframe with 8760 rows (one for each hour of year 2023) with the following columns:

- Day of the year
- hour of the day 
- average trafic intensity during this hour 
- average trafic speed during this hour
- number of seconds the Sloebrug bridge is open during this hour
- average weather conditions during this hour
- one-hot encoded binary values to indicate wither the day is a holiday
- if we have enough time - lag features for the previous hour 

Target - average trafic speed
Metric - MAE
Basic modelling technique - Linear Regression
